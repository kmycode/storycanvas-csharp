{"Name":"HockeyApp for iOS (Crash Only)","Id":3063,"Alias":"hockeyappios-crashonly","Description":"HockeyApp is a platform to collect live crash reports, get feedback from your users, distribute your betas, recruit new testers, and analyze your test coverage.\n\nThe following features are currently supported:\n\n - **Collect crash reports:** If your app crashes, a crash log is written to the device\u0027s storage. If the user starts the app again, they will be asked asked to submit the crash report to HockeyApp. This works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain viable information for you to help resolve the issue. Furthermore, you as a developer can add additional information to the report as well.\n\n\nThis is the Crash Only version of HockeySDK for iOS.\n\n\n## Learn More\nLearn more about HockeyApp by visiting http://hockeyapp.net","Version":"4.1.0.3","Summary":"HockeyApp is a platform to collect live crash reports, get feedback from your users, distribute your betas, recruit new testers, and analyze your test coverage.","QuickStart":"## Obtain an App Identifier\n\nPlease see the [How to create a new app](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/about-general-faq/how-to-create-a-new-app) tutorial. This will provide you with a HockeyApp specific App Identifier to be used to initialize the SDK.\n\n## Add crash reporting\n\nThis will add crash reporting capabilities to your app. \n\nOpen your AppDelegate.cs file, and add the following lines:\n\n```csharp\nusing HockeyApp.iOS;\n\nnamespace YourNameSpace\n{\n\t[Register(\"AppDelegate\")]\n\tpublic partial class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate\n\t{\n\t\tpublic override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tvar manager = BITHockeyManager.SharedHockeyManager;\n\t\t\tmanager.Configure(\"Your_App_Id\");\n\t\t\tmanager.StartManager();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Control logging output\n\nYou can control the amount of log messages from HockeySDK.  By default, we keep the noise as low as possible, only errors will show up. To enable additional logging, i.e. while debugging, add the following line of code:\n\n```csharp\nvar manager = BITHockeyManager.SharedHockeyManager;\nmanager.Configure(\"Your_App_Id\");\nmanager.SetDebugLogEnabled = true;\nmanager.StartManager();\n```\n\n\n## More Information\n\nFor more information, see the [HockeySDK for Xamarin Source Repository](https://github.com/bitstadium/HockeySDK-Xamarin)\n","Hash":"1c54135242e05320d94ba39bd241170c","TargetPlatforms":["ios","ios-unified"],"TrialHash":null}
